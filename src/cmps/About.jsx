            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m a software developer with a passion for web design, focusing on creating and maintaining websites and web applications.
                Born in England and relocated to Israel, where I grew up, served as a commander in the Israeli Navy and studied in the Hebrew University.
                While I studied Biology my true interest lies in technology, which led me to focus on programming, particularly in web development.
                <br />
                <br />
                I thrive in team environments, enjoying collaboration and contributing to projects through clear communication and dedication. 
                Besides programming, I love animals, traveling, and spending time in nature. Photography is another passion of mine, allowing me to capture the world from unique perspectives.
