            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>
                I’m a software developer with a passion for web design, focusing on creating and maintaining websites and web applications.
                Born in England and now based in Israel, I served as a commander in the Israeli Navy (IDF), where I gained leadership skills and discipline that have shaped both my professional and personal life.
                While I studied biology at Hebrew University, my true interest lies in technology, and I’ve since focused on building efficient and intuitive web solutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                I thrive in team environments, enjoying collaboration and contributing to projects through clear communication and dedication. Outside of work, I love traveling, hiking, skiing, and spending time in nature. Photography is another passion of mine, allowing me to capture the world from unique perspectives. With a strong technical foundation and a people-oriented approach, I’m committed to creating effective, professional web experiences.
